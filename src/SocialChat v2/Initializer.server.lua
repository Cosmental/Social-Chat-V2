	Additional Notes:
	
		Hey, this is a personal message from myself as a means of thanking YOU (the developer) for using my open sourced Chat System! Initially
		this was going to be a fun little open sourced tool for others to use, but after seeing all the support from you guys it really fuelled my
		passion and encouraged me to add so much more into the system!
		
		While I may be a solo developer working my best to provide the best possible system for you all to enjoy, this is all worth it in the end
		because I get to see other people enjoy my work and make creative things out of it!
		
		Thanks for using SocialChat!
		- Cos
		
		PS: If you'd like to support any future updates/content for the system, feel free to donate to support any future updates!
