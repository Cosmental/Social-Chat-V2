# Channels
The Channels component in Social Chat is responsible for managing chat channels on the server-side. It handles essential functionalities such as message filtering, message storage, network limitations
to prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and replication of Speaker metadata.

## Filtering
The Channels component implements a robust filtering mechanism (provided by Roblox) to ensure that messages sent by players comply with Roblox's Terms of Service and community guidelines. This helps
maintain a safe and appropriate chat environment. In accordance to Roblox's Terms of Service, any flagged messages will be sent to Roblox servers for moderation evaluation.

## Message Storage
Social Chat's Channels component facilitates the storage and retrieval of chat messages. It manages the persistence of messages, allowing players to view past messages within a channel. The stored
messages can be accessed for moderation purposes or to provide a history of chat interactions within the game.

## Network Limitations
To prevent potential DDoS attacks or excessive resource consumption, the Channels component enforces network limitations. This ensures that players cannot flood the chat system with a high volume of
messages in a short period. The network limitations help maintain server stability and prevent abuse of the chat system.

## Speaker Metadata Replication
The Channels component handles the replication of Speaker metadata across clients. Speaker metadata holds information about the player such as their display name, tagdata, visual appearance (in chat)
and more in the forseeable future.

:::tip
The Channels component on the Server side is responsible for critical aspects of Social Chat's functionality, including message filtering, storage, network limitations, and metadata replication.
Understanding how to configure and utilize this component effectively will help ensure a secure and reliable chat system for your game.

In the following sections, we will explore each aspect of the Channels component in detail, explaining how to configure and customize its behavior to suit your needs!

# Documentation

:::caution
Some methods are only available for certain environments. You must use the
API documentation that associates with the type of script you are working
with.

This is due to Roblox's [**`Client-Server Model`**](https://create.roblox.com/docs/projects/client-server)
which is required when it comes to game security.

## Methods

Social Chat follows a PascalCase Object Oriented approach, where functions and methods are named using capital letters for each word. Keep this in mind when working with the API methods of the
'Channels' component. Let's explore some of the key methods available:

### ChannelAPI.new(Name: string) : Channel
Creates a new channel with the specified name. This method returns a Channel object representing the newly created channel. Remember to provide a unique name for each channel you create.

### ChannelAPI:Get(Query: string) : Channel
Retrieves the requested channel based on its name. Please note that the channel name is case sensitive. This method returns a Channel object representing the requested channel.

### ChannelAPI:Message(Speaker: Speaker, Message: string, Recipient: Player | Channel)
Sends a new message from the specified speaker to the specified recipient using the provided parameters. The Speaker parameter represents the player sending the message, the Message parameter contains
the content of the message, and the Recipient parameter can be either a Player or a Channel object.

### ChannelAPI:AddValidator(Callback: callback)
Adds a message validator to the ChannelAPI. This allows users to control how messages are filtered before they are processed by Roblox's filtering system. You can provide a callback function that
accepts a message as input and decides whether to accept or deny it. This can be useful for implementing custom filters for specific purposes like admin commands.

### ChannelAPI.OnMessageSent: RBXScriptSignal
This signal fires whenever a message is sent, allowing you to listen and respond to messages in real-time. The signal returns a Speaker object, a Message string, and the Recipient player or channel. Note that this signal provides unfiltered messages.


:::tip
Remember to follow the PascalCase naming convention when using the API methods of the 'Channels' component in Social Chat. These methods provide functionality for creating channels, sending messages, managing subscribers, and more. Take advantage of these methods to build a robust and interactive chat system for your game.
