# Social Chat v2

Ready to modernize? Here's how you can get the most out of SocialChat v2!

### Getting Started

To get started, create a script (Client or Server) and **require** the asset from ``ReplicatedStorage``!
```lua
local SocialChat = require(game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("SocialChat"));
```

:::note
This method of requiring SocialChat works on both Client, and Server environments!
:::

---
### API Reference
Some methods are only available for certain environments. You must use the
API documentation that associates with the type of script you are working
with!

This is due to the [**`Client-Server Model`**](https://create.roblox.com/docs/projects/client-server) and
for security purposes as well!

:::tip
Social Chat currently uses [**Object-Oriented**](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/all-about-object-oriented-programming/8585)
programming with variables and functions in `PascalCase`.
:::


:::info
Please note that all SocialChat API methods come from their derived components, and **NOT** the module itself!
If you would like to use any of these api‚Äôs, please reference the **Src** variable to extract
the API's source elements.

```lua title="Example:"
local SocialChat = require(game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("SocialChat"));
local API_TO_GET = SocialChat.Src.API_TO_GET -- This should be the API component you are trying to use

--- Example Reference:
local Channels = SocialChat.Src.Channels
Channels:ThisMethod() -- runs ":ThisMethod()" from the Channels component!
```
