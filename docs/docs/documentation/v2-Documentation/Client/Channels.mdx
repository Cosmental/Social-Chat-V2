# Channels (Server)
The Channels component in Social Chat is responsible for managing chat channels on the server-side. It handles essential functionalities such as message filtering, message storage, network limitations
to prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and replication of Speaker metadata.

## Filtering
The Channels component implements a robust filtering mechanism to ensure that messages sent by players comply with Roblox's Terms of Service and community guidelines. This helps maintain a safe and
appropriate chat environment. Messages that violate the guidelines are automatically filtered and blocked from being displayed to other players.

## Message Storage
Social Chat's Channels component facilitates the storage and retrieval of chat messages. It manages the persistence of messages, allowing players to view past messages within a channel. The stored
messages can be accessed for moderation purposes or to provide a history of chat interactions within the game.

## Network Limitations
To prevent potential DDoS attacks or excessive resource consumption, the Channels component enforces network limitations. This ensures that players cannot flood the chat system with a high volume of
messages in a short period. The network limitations help maintain server stability and prevent abuse of the chat system.

## Speaker Metadata Replication
The Channels component handles the replication of Speaker metadata across clients. Speaker metadata includes information about the chat user, such as display name, role, or any other relevant details.
This allows for consistent display of user information in the chat interface across all connected players.

:::tip
The Channels component on the Server side is responsible for critical aspects of Social Chat's functionality, including message filtering, storage, network limitations, and metadata replication.
Understanding how to configure and utilize this component effectively will help ensure a secure and reliable chat system for your game.

# Documentation

:::caution
Some methods are only available for certain environments. You must use the
API documentation that associates with the type of script you are working
with.

This is due to Roblox's [**`Client-Server Model`**](https://create.roblox.com/docs/projects/client-server)
which is required when it comes to game security.
:::

## Methods

### Channels.new()

Registers a new channel under the executed environment. This method should
be used on the **Server and Client** in order to work properly. If the
channel is created on just the client, the server will not be able to see
or send messages to other users.

#### Parameters:
| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Name | `string` | nil | The designated Channel name for this instance. |

```lua
local SocialChat = require(game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("SocialChat"));
local Channels = SocialChat.Src.Channels

local Example = Channels.new("MyNewChannel"); -- Creates a channel named
Example:myMethod(); -- Runs "myMethod" on the 'MyNewChannel' object
```
