# Social Chat v2

Ready to modernize? Here's how you can get started with SocialChat's adhesive API!

### Getting Started

To get started, create a script (Client or Server) and **require** the asset from ``ReplicatedStorage``!
```lua
local SocialChat = require(game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("SocialChat"));
```
<br/>

:::tip
This method of requiring SocialChat works on **both** Client, and Server environments!

**SocialChat v2** uses the same approach as the original v1 API by using
a table **Src** (source) reference to use API compontents seperately. This
helps reduce API clutter as well as keeping everything structured for developers
to use!

Normally, requiring the resource will return the following:
```lua
{
  ["Extensions"] = {...}, -- These can only be viewed on the client. The server will see an empty array
  ["Library"] = {...}, -- Library Modules used by your current environment.
  ["Settings"] = {...}, -- SocialChat configurations for your given environment. The Server can see client configurations
  ["Src"] = {...} -- The source array that holds all SocialChat components.
};
```
<br/>

We want to focus on the **`Src`** item, as it holds every API component we can access
provided by SocialChat! Below is an example of a script that references the **`Src`**
item from SocialChat to access the [**`Channels`**](./Channels) API!

```lua title="Example:"
local SocialChat = require(game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("SocialChat"));
local Channels = SocialChat.Src.Channels -- Returns the "Channels" API module from the 'Src' table

Channels:ThisMethod() -- Now we can freely use API methods from the "Channels" API!
```
<br/>

:::caution IMPORTANT:
Social Chat currently uses [**Object-Oriented**](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/all-about-object-oriented-programming/8585)
programming with variables and functions in `PascalCase`.
